### How To Trust
The entire data set in made available to the public, where anybody can cross verify anytime. We are entirely transparent. We'll consider adding links, only if the links are sent from their official email address. For example a link belonging to Microsoft is added only if they are sent from an official @microsoft.com email address. So anyone who sent from @xyz.com cannot add link related with Microsoft. A new company or organisatiopn will be added to a temporary waiting list, and will only be added to the main databse once we were able to verify that company.
